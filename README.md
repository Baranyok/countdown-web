# Countdown - web version

## About

This is a school project for my User Interface Programming course. My assignment was to make an aplication that would communicate with the school Google account, specifically the Google Calendar API and allow the user to display all their events in their calendars and calculate the time that is remaining until (or has passed since) the event.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.6.

## Running the aplication

Run `npm install` to install aplication dependencies, then run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Using the aplication 

If you want to log into the aplication, make sure you are using your `@vutbr.cz` email address.
